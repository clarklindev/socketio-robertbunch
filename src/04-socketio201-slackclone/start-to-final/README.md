# Slack App
- to get this working
- install packages...
- `nodemon slackClone/server-slack.js`
- localhost:9000/slack.html

```cmd
//slackClone from folder: 04-socketio201/
nodemon slackClone/server-slack.js 
```

## NOTE:

- the project has some CONS:

1. it is using commonjs not using esmodules
2. code is not refactored / grouped
3. client code doesnt use react but rather manipulates the DOM
4. its working but useless will take a month to refactor and clean up to workable solution 
5. decided to "fork" and create repository 'socketio-nextjs'
